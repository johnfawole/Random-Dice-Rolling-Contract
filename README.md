# Random-Dice-Rolling-Contract

This contract makes it possible for 20 people to roll dice with unpredictable results in each of the instances.

In this project, I learned more about how to use the Chainlink oracle. I read extensively to solidify my knowledge of how Chainlink works. 

I documented other things I learned within the code. Read the comments well.

Look out for the next project I'd be trying out.
